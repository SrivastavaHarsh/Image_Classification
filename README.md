# Image_Classification
This repository (written in Python) contains code to classify images using global features such as shape, texture and color.

# Requirements :

# Usage :

  
# Key insights this project :
## Descriptors used :
  **For shape** : Hu Moments
  For texture : Local Binary Groups
  For colour : Color Histogram
  
  The features extacted from the individual descriptors are simply added together to get the feature vector for an image.
 
##  ML-Model used : 
   Random Decision Forest : Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a                             multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression)                             of the individual trees.
